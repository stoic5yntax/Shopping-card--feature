# 🛒 E-Commerce Shopping Cart (Vanilla JS)

A simple **e-commerce shopping cart application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates a basic e-commerce site where users can **browse sneaker products, add/remove items from the cart, view invoice details, and print the invoice**.  
All cart data is saved in **LocalStorage**, so the cart persists even after a page reload.
